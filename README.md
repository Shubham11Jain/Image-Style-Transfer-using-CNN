# Image-Style-Transfer-using-CNN
This assignment is based on a Deep Learning Model - CNN which is used for the image style transfer.

# Problem
Objective is to apply the style of an image, which we will term as "style image" to a target image while preserving the content of the target image.

1. Style is textures and visual patterns in an image. Example is brush strokes of an artist
2. Content is the macro structure of an image, like buildings, people, objects in the content of the image.

# High Level Steps
1. choose the image to style
2. choose the style reference image (here we have provided a Picasso style image)
3. choose a pre-trained deep neural network (CNN type) and obtain feature representations of intermediate layers. This step is done to achieve the representations of both the content image and style image. For the content image, best option is to obtain the feature representations of highest layers as they would contain information on the image macro-structure. For the style reference image, feature representations are obtained from multiple layers at different scales.
4. define loss function
5. Loss function should be taking into account the Content-loss, Style-loss, Variation-loss.
6. Optimize on each iteration to minimize the loss

# Recommended Overview of the steps generally followed
1. Create a random input image
2. Pass the input through a pre-trained backbone architecture
3. Calculate loss and compute the gradients w.r.t input image pixels. Hence only the input pixels are adjusted whereas the weights remain constant.

# This problem consists of two sub problems:
1. To generate the content and
2. To generate the style

The images are attached : The input Image and the Style Image.
